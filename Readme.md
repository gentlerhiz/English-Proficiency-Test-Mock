**FOREWORD**

*Test of English for Higher Degree Admissions: Sample Questions* is a text specially prepared for applicants to the different Master degree programmes of the University of Ibadan. It is meant to intimate them with the level of English to be considered in examining them for qualification for admission or interactive sessions/entrance examinations leading to final admission. Thus, the text represents the nature of the questions to be asked in the examination.

The test, as shown in the samples in this publication, will cover aspects of English grammar, vocabulary choices (for general and professional purposes) and acceptable style of writing. This design has been informed by the extremely low level of English language competence observed among our graduate students, a number of whom could not construct the simplest intelligible sentence of English after completing their programmes. If this happens at the University of Ibadan in spite of the rigorous and intensive programmes that we run, then it should be worse in most other universities. Given that all universities source students from the same public pool, it is not exaggerative to say that the Nigerian university system may fail to achieve its goals if this situation is not remedied.

Against the above background, the University of Ibadan has decided to sort out the issue of linguistic expressivity right from the entry point into the university’s higher degree programmes. In other words, it is only those who could communicate effectively in English at the level required of a graduate student that WILL be considered for admission processing.

It should be understood that the test is not with the intention to deliberately and uncritically weed off candidates. Rather, it is designed to improve the quality of our graduates and brighten their chances in society. Hence, the sample questions, with their answers, in this text, are to assist them to understand what is expected of them in the examination. The syllabus is provided for them to be informed about the extent of the preparation they have to make. Applicants may consult the recommended texts and other standard books that adequately treat the topics listed in the syllabus.

As you will be instructed presently in this publication, you could practise the questions as many times as possible, scoring and rating yourself in each attempt. These efforts are expected to be complemented with hands on tasks undertaken through practices indicated in standard and relevant books.

The road to a reputable graduate programme is not a smooth one, but its end product is fulfilling, rewarding and distinctive. We all must strive towards putting the University of Ibadan Postgraduate School on this pedestal, where it has always been.

I wish you all the best of luck in the test.

Thank you.

Prof. Abel Olorunnisola,  
Dean,  
The Postgraduate School,  
University of Ibadan.
